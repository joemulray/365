1. What is the importance of the default route? What are some possible issues when you donâ€™t have your default route setup correctly?

	The default route is a setting on a computer that defines a forwarding rule to use when no specific route can be determined for a IP address. All the packets for routes that are not established in the routing table are sent using the default route. Some of the issues when you dont have your default route setup correctly are drop the requests leading it to be unreachable.


2. Run a traceroute to andere.tallwireless.com . What can you tell about the path the traffic is taking? Can you identify the cities the traffic is passing through?

	You can see the different destinations that each packet is taking, some of the cities it is passing through are Philadelphia, Seattle, Ann Arbor, New York City, Houston, Louisville, and Pomona.


3. What is the subnet mask for your hosts? How many hosts can be contained within that subnet?

	The subnet mask for my hosts are 255.255.252.0. Each host can contain 1022 hosts within that subnet. 


4. Run a traceroute to teaching.tallwireless.com . What are the difference compared to andere.tallwireless.com within the first 3 hops?

	Security and filtering are somethings to keep in consideration when developing a policy to secure a network. Also roles play a cruicial part in access to areas that need monitoring or special access. It is very important to have a policy that is secure and can be easily modified if needed be
